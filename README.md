# Swanson Quotes w/ Async Redux - React Redux App

## Introduction

This project was created as part of the Lambda School curriculum and focused on completing asynchronous API calls with a React application in conjunction with Redux state management. I was free to choose an open API to make calls to with the following requirements:

"Choose an open api ([this list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) has a lot of great ones - look for ones with `Auth: no` and `HTTPS: yes` - or just do a google search for `open apis`)."

I settled on an open API for a database of quotes from the fictional character Ron Swanson from the show Parks and Recreation simply because I enjoyed the character on the show.


## What the Application Does

1. A `user` can generate up to 10 random quotes from Ron Swanson that display on page
2. A `user` can search for quotes that match a single keyword
3. An `user` can clear quote results and start fresh


## Technologies Used

- The app was built using React as a single page application
- Styling is built using Material UI framework
- Global application state management utilizes Redux
- API calls are made using the axios library
